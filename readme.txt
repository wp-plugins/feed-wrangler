FeedWrangler is a utility for creating and editing custom feeds.

== Description ==

Feed Wrangler is a simple plugin that allows one to create custom feeds for their WordPress blog. You can customize the structure of that feed by creating a corresponding file in your blog theme, otherwise the custom feed will default to your RSS2 feed.

Some possible use cases for the plugin:

* You want a custom URL to access a feed by (i.e. "/feed/misterspecialfeed" )
* You want some feeds to bypass Feedburner redirect.
* A sponsor asks you to place an ad in your feed
* You need a clean, ad-free feed to provide a partner (see Amazon Kindle), that doesn't go through FeedBurner or is customized in any way.
* You prefer adding and editing feeds in a way more analogous to Movable Type


== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "Settings" > "Feed Wrangler" to create a new feed.

== Screenshots ==
